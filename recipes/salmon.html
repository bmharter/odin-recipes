        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 six oz salmon filets</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely chopped shallots</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Chardonnay or Pinot Grigio</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>1/2 packet unflavored gelatin</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 lemon (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol><h3>The Fish</h3>
        <p>For best flavor, use a deep stainless steel or cast iron skillet. Do not use nonstick.</p>
        <p>
            <li>Put the gelatin in the stock so it can hydrate for 10 minutes before using.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of the fillet generously with kosher salt and black pepper. Kosher salt is not as salty as table salt, and the black pepper will mild out as it is cooked, so don’t be stingy.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Once it is shimmering, place the salmon in the pan skin side up. Cook the salmon until the internal temp is 140-145, usually about 6 minutes each side. The salmon will be deeply golden.</li>
            <li>Plate the salmon and cover it with foil to retain heat, and let it rest while you make the pan sauce.</li></p>
        <h3>The Sauce</h3>
        <p>
            <li>The bits of fish, meat, or whatever protein you cooked left on the pan is called fond. It adds a lot of flavor to a pan sauce. We want it.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Cook the chopped shallots until translucent, but not brown (if they start browning it’s fine, just move on.)</li>
            <li>Towards the end, add the garlic cloves, and let them cook with the shallots 30 second to a minute, or until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Deglaze the pan by pouring the wine over it, then the stock. Scrape the bits of fond off the bottom of the pan. If you know you want lemon (I don’t think it’s needed, but you’re like most people), you can squeeze half a lemon now (a whole lemon if you really like it that fucking much). If I’m eating this with you, you will hold off on that.
            Let simmer for 5-7 minutes.</li></p>
        <h3>Finishing</h3>
        <p>
            <li>Turn the heat to high or medium high and reduce aggressively. The higher you set it, the faster it will burn, and the less you can walk away.</li>
            <li>The sauce is sufficiently reduced when you run a spoon across the pot and it leaves a trail, and the back of the spoon is coated.
            When it is reduced, turn off the heat let it sit 30 seconds, and add the cold butter, and stir in until melted. Add a dash of kosher salt and some pepper. Remove the garlic cloves.</li>
            <li>Pour generously over the fillets. If you haven’t added lemon yet, you can do so to the individual fillets.</li></ol></p>
